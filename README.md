# Uncommon HTML Bug: XSS Vulnerability from unsanitized innerHTML

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, HTML bug that leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The bug stems from directly assigning unsanitized user input to the `innerHTML` property of an HTML element.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML page that prompts the user for input.  This input is then directly assigned to the `innerHTML` of a div element.  This is dangerous because if a malicious user enters JavaScript code, it will be executed by the browser.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the correct approach.  Instead of directly using `innerHTML`, it uses `textContent`, which avoids the execution of any potentially malicious JavaScript code.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Enter some malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS!');</script>`) into the prompt.  You will see an alert box appear, indicating the XSS vulnerability.
4. Repeat with `bugSolution.html`. No alert box will appear, demonstrating the secure solution.

This example highlights the importance of always sanitizing user input before using it in your HTML, especially when dealing with the `innerHTML` property.  Use `textContent` whenever possible for setting text content to avoid XSS vulnerabilities.
